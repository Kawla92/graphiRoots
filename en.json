  "about_text": "Creative, curious and passionate, I took my first steps in graphic design as a self-taught artist. Thanks to accessible resources like YouTube, I nurtured my visual sensibility and acquired a solid foundation in design. My desire to learn naturally led me to platforms such as OpenClassrooms, where I strengthened my web design skills (HTML & CSS). Driven by the desire to deepen my knowledge, I followed the UI/UX Design specialization from CalArts on Coursera, a comprehensive training that introduced me to user-centered design methodologies, web and mobile mockup creation, wireframes, and the strategic thinking behind a good user experience. In parallel, I completed a 300-hour certification in Responsive Web Design on freeCodeCamp, which allowed me to master responsive integration and modern front-end development best practices. Always on the lookout for innovations, I also integrate artificial intelligence into my creation processes. I use tools like Cursor AI to optimize code writing, automate certain tasks and test my ideas more quickly, making my projects more fluid and efficient.",
